## About me

Software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast, currently studying physics, with a strong interest in systems, networks, and applied science.

I build experimental tools, prototypes, and small-scale systems to better understand how things work under the hood from software and security to hardware interaction and cryptography.

This profile is a workspace for learning, experimentation, and practical problem-solving.
